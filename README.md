# myFlix-app Backend
Movie API

## Description:
Creating a backend API to store information about movies and allow users to create lists of favorite movies.


## Reflections on this project:
My role as a full stack developer would be to understand how to utilize the tools for the backend server before going to the frontend. 
I created a database of movies and users using Node.Js and Express. One of the difficulties I faced in this project was learning how to
undo and erase my spelling mistakes. Using Node does not allow me to simply select with my mouse and hit backspace. One valuable lesson I learned
is to always proofread my information before saving. Another lesson I learned is the importance of password-jwt. Since users are inputing their private 
information, it is all the more important to implement a security feature that blocks outsiders from stealing it.
